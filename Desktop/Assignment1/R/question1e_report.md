# Part E – Data Storytelling Report

## 1. Summary of Findings
The analysis of Malaysia’s population data (Parts A–D) reveals a total population of approximately **34.2 million** (as of 2025). The data highlights significant disparities in population distribution across the country, with urbanization playing a central role. Measures of central tendency show a mean state population of **2.14 million**, but with a very high Coefficient of Variation (CV > 85%), indicating that the population is not evenly distributed but rather concentrated in a few key areas.

## 2. Key Population Patterns
- **Regional Variation**: The **Central Region** (e.g., Selangor, Kuala Lumpur) is the most populous, averaging **2.71 million** per state, while the **East Coast Region** averages significantly lower (**1.61 million**). This suggests a strong migration trend toward economic hubs.
- **State Disparity**: A direct comparison shows **Selangor (~3.96 million)** has nearly triple the population of **Kelantan (~1.32 million)**. The boxplot analysis confirms that the Central region contains the outliers with the highest density.
- **Gender Balance**: The population shows a slight male dominance, with approximately **52.5% male** (17.96M) and **47.5% female** (16.27M).
- **Age Structure**: While detailed age histograms were generated in Part B, the general pattern aligns with a developing nation demographic, though the focus here remains on the sheer magnitude of regional concentration.

## 3. Policy Insights and Recommendations
- **Urban Planning**: The heavy concentration in the Central Region demands prioritized investment in **urban infrastructure**, public transport, and housing to prevent congestion and declining living standards.
- **Resource Allocation**: Policymakers should not allocate resources simply by state count but by population density. Selangor requires proportionally more healthcare and education funding than East Coast states.
- **Decentralization**: To reduce the strain on the Central Region, economic policies could encourage **industrial development in the East Coast and Northern regions** to create jobs and curb excessive migration to the Klang Valley.
